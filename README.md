# 1122_5G-network
5G system consists of **5G NR (new radio)** and **5G core network**. 
The two hands-on sections in this course introduce the Matlab 5G Toolbox (for 5G NR) and GNS3 (for network) to familiarize students with the 5G technologies with these tools, references, and examples.
- Matlab 5G tool - 5G Toolbox provides standard-compliant functions and reference examples for the modeling, simulating, and verifying 5G New Radio (NR) communications systems. 
- GNS3 - Graphical Network Simulator-3 is a network software emulator first released in 2008. It allows the combination of virtual and real devices to simulate complex networks.
